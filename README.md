# HTTP5222 Assignment 2: React Frontend

This repository contains the source code for the React front-end developed as part of HTTP5222 Assignment 2. The project consumes data from the backend API created in Assignment 1. The API (built with Express) exposes endpoints for portfolio or small business data, and the React app retrieves this data to dynamically render the site content.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a modern React application that connects to a separate backend API service. In this assignment, the API (developed in Assignment 1) is deployed with CORS enabled so that the front-end can fetch data seamlessly. The front-end is designed for a portfolio site (or similar small business site), showcasing important details such as:
  
- The developerâ€™s name and desired role
- A list of projects, each with a screenshot, URL, brief description, and languages/technologies used
- Contact information and a functioning contact form

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The UI is built with responsiveness and clean aesthetics in mind.
- **Dynamic Data Fetching:** Utilizes HTTP requests to retrieve data from the backend API.
- **Project Portfolio:** Displays project information including images, project links, and descriptions.
- **Contact Section:** Provides users an easy way to get in touch via a contact form or direct contact details.
- **Deployment Ready:** Configured for deployment on popular platforms (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or Heroku).
